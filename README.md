# Todo App using Redux Toolkit

## What is Reux Toolkit?
This is a tool to make State Management more efficient and simple without the developer stressing about Reux initial setup and onlyu focus on the app's logic. 

It handles immutibility of the state on the core so the developer can use array.push, filter, map, etc ( all the high order functions) on the state directly.

Great tool indeed.
